Examples from the preprint D. P. Bourne, M. Pearce & S. M. Roper (2022) Geometric modelling of polycrystalline materials: Laguerre tessellations and periodic semi-discrete optimal transport. ADD LINK TO PDF OF PREPRINT. 

We also need to upload a snapshot of MatGeom somewhere (with the replacement file intersectPlaneMesh) and the following visualisation files: 
- intersect_cells_on_boundary_periodic
- generateGrainsColours
- patchpolygons
- cells_intersect_plane
- clip-with-planes

Also need to upload the error plotting files
- cdnum
- plotErrors
