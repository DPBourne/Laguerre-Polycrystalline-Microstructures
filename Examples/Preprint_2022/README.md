Examples from the preprint 
* Bourne, D.P., Pearce M. & Roper, S.M. (2022) Geometric modelling of polycrystalline materials: Laguerre tessellations and periodic semi-discrete optimal transport.  

We also need to upload a snapshot of MatGeom somewhere (with the replacement file intersectPlaneMesh) and the following visualisation files: 
* intersect_cells_on_boundary_periodic
* generateGrainsColours
* patchpolygons
* cells_intersect_plane
* clip-with-planes
