This folder contains some examples of how to generate Laguerre diagrams with cells of prescribed volumes using the Python library [pysdot](https://github.com/sd-ot/pysdot).

The ipynb files run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). They also run in Jupyter Notebook if you have [pysdot](https://github.com/sd-ot/pysdot) and [VTK](https://pypi.org/project/vtk/) installed.
